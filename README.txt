1. Why NOIR?
________________________________________________________________________________

NOIR is a project I've wanted to embark on since my days of LFS, the whole idea of
owning my own distro simply facinates me and taking advantage of the work done
by @kisslinux I was able to.

2. Whats Different?
________________________________________________________________________________

NOIR aims to become a minimal general purpose distro for
your pleasure;

 - Cuttin down on all dependancies and all other bloat to provide you with a functional distro
with as few packages and a much less combined package weight
as possible.

 - Taking notes from Wyverkiss we want to be as GNU free as we
can and if we can't at least make GNU software optional.


3. NOIR & KISS
________________________________________________________________________________

The NOIR main repositories will be kept as close to the KISS main repositories [for now]
so as to allow users to swap between repositories whenever they see it fit.
