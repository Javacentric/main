#### Why NOIR?
________________________________________________________________________________

NOIR is a project I've wanted to embark on since my days of LFS, the whole idea of
owning my own distro simply facinates me and taking advantage of the work done
by @kisslinux I was able to.

#### Whats Different?
________________________________________________________________________________

NOIR has a few goals in mind that it aims to attain but until everything is set
in some running order all work will be be at users risk.

#### NOIR & KISS
________________________________________________________________________________

The NOIR main repositories will be kept as close to the KISS main repositories
so as to allow users to swap between repositories whenever they see it fit.
